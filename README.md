## Overview
The Micromouse project at BITS Robocon is a captivating exploration into the realm of robotics and autonomous systems. This project challenges participants to design, build, and program a small robot capable of autonomously navigating through a maze. The primary goal is to develop efficient maze-solving algorithms that enable the robot to find the optimal path from the maze's entrance to its center or exit.

## Components
### Hardware
- **Chassis:** The physical structure of the robot designed for agility and efficient movement.
- **Motors and Wheels:** Drive the robot's motion through the maze.
- **Sensors:** Typically, infrared sensors are used for wall detection and maze navigation.
- **Microcontroller (Arduino):** Serves as the brain of the Micromouse, processing sensor data and controlling motors.
- **Power Supply:** Reliable batteries provide the necessary power for the robot's autonomy.

### Software
- **Arduino Code:** The heart of the project, the Arduino code dictates the behavior of the Micromouse. It includes maze-solving algorithms and logic for sensor integration.
- **Maze-Solving Algorithms:** Participants implement algorithms such as Dijkstra's or A* to find the optimal path through the maze.
- **Sensor Integration:** Code interprets sensor data to make real-time decisions about the robot's movement.

## Repository
The repository associated with BITS Robocon's Micromouse project contains the Arduino codebase. This serves as a collaborative hub for team members, facilitating version control, code sharing, and ongoing development. It encapsulates the collective efforts of the team in creating an intelligent and efficient maze-solving robot.

The Micromouse project not only provides a hands-on experience in robotics but also challenges participants to think critically about algorithm design and optimization, offering a holistic learning journey within the exciting field of autonomous robotics.
